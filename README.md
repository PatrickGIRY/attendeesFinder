# Attendees finder

## Feature

**As** an event organizer, **I want to** search for registered attendees by first name, **in order to** be able to create the list of attendees actually present at the event.
## Acceptance criteria

* The finder should return an empty result when no attendee first name matches the query string.
* The finder should return one result when only one attendee first name matches the query string.
* The finder should return all the results when many attendees first names matche the query string.
